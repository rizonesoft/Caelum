# Contributing to Rizonesoft Glide

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Glide**! This guide will help you get started.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20+ (LTS recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- A code editor — [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) recommended
- A [Google Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
- A Microsoft 365 account (free [Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program) account works)

### Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Glide.git
   cd Glide
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file and add your Gemini API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Code Style

- **TypeScript** — all source code is written in TypeScript
- **Prettier** — code formatting is enforced via `.prettierrc`
- **ESLint** — linting rules are defined in `.eslintrc.json`
- **EditorConfig** — editor settings in `.editorconfig` (2-space indent, UTF-8, LF)

Run the formatter and linter before committing:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```
